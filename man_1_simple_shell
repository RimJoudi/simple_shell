.SH Overview
The shell is a command interpreter that reads lines from input and interprets them, and generally executes other commands.

.SH Invocation
Typically the shell will be run in interactive mode where input is accepted from
the keyboard.

In non-interactive mode, the shell is run from a script or
something similar.This subshell only opens when the script is executed and
subsequently closes once the script is finished.

.SH Simple_shell return
A new prompt "$ " waiting for a new command.

.SH Examples
